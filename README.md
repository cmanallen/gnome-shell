This is a collection of my gnome-shell themes.  If you would like to contribute please do so through github @ github.com/cmanallen/gnome-shell.


Please back up your old gnome-shell.css theme (e.g. gnome-shell(copy).css)
To install sudo cp ~/Downloads/refined-shell/gnome-shell.css /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/gnome-shell.css

I plan on making custom svg art for these themes at some point in the future, as well as packaging the themes properly so you don't have to overwrite your default gnome-shell theme.
